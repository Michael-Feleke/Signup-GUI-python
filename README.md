## Add Your Own Image

To add your own image to the code at line number 142, please follow these steps:

1. Prepare your image: Make sure you have the image you want to use ready on your local machine. The image can be in any common format such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF.

2. Rename the image: Rename your image file to something meaningful and unique. Avoid using spaces or special characters in the file name to ensure compatibility.

3. Replace the placeholder image: Open the source code file and navigate to line number 142. You will find a placeholder image reference at that line.

4. Replace the image path: Replace the path of the placeholder image with the path of your own image. The path can be either relative to the code file or an absolute path. Make sure to include the correct file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
